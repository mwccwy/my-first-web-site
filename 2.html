    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are
    styled, laid out, etc.</p>
    <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language,
    but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
    <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox,
    Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or
    printer.</p>
